## Introduction
Before successfully starting a job at a company, you must demonstrate that you are a suitable candidate for the role. Getting a job can be challenging and may require attending several interviews before finding a position suited to your skill set. Ideally, you are looking for one where you are the strongest candidate for the role. It is essential to realize that even if you are well-suited to a position, there is always the possibility that a more experienced candidate is also being interviewed. So, even though you did not get a role, you could still have had a good interview. 

## Prepare
*Here are some of the standard questions that you may encounter in any given interview:*
- Tell me about yourself.

- Why do you feel that they should hire you?

- What are your major strengths?

- Or, what are your major weaknesses?

- What pay are you expecting?

- How do your previous experiences make you suitable for this role?

- What do your friends say about you?

- Why do you want this role?

- How have you dealt with conflict in the past?

## Soft skills
Conflict resolution is an essential soft skill to possess. Invariably in your working life, you will encounter a situation where your approach or goals do not align with those of a colleague, employer, or customer. Managing these situations helps create a harmonious working environment. Be cognizant of when you have clashed with people and how you resolved it. Did you find this approach to be successful? If not, then do some research on how to deal with conflict in the workplace. 

## Presentation
It's frequently said, "dress for the job you want, not the job you have." How you present yourself can subconsciously convey much information about you. Be neat and respectable. Your future work colleagues may be on the panel, and you want to make a good impression. The attire you wear should be suitable for the role. Pride in appearance can be equated with pride in a role. 

## Demeanor
Demonstrate enthusiasm and composure in the interview, emphasizing your interest, active listening, competency with STAR answers, and thoughtful questions. Stay authentic, prioritizing honesty over exaggeration to ensure a genuine match between your skills and the position.

## Virtual interviews 
In virtual interviews, prioritize technical readiness, including sound and video quality, attire, and professional body language. Secure a quiet, dedicated space, mimicking office decorum to avoid distractions and present yourself effectively in the virtual setting.
