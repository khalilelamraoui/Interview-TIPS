## Introduction
A valuable tool in a programmer's toolbox is pseudocode. In this reading, you will learn about why you should use pseudocode, when it should be used, and how to write pseudocode. 

## Why should you use pseudocode?
Pseudocode, a crucial initial step in problem-solving, provides a high-level representation of ideas resembling code. It prompts thoughtful consideration at each stage, allowing for adaptability in decisions and preventing potential constraints in subsequent steps.

## When should you write pseudocode?
- As a beginner, when plotting out the planned progress of your approach.

- As an experienced programmer, when attempting to wrestle with a complex problem.

- If you are trying to convey a concept to an influential audience, such as a team or potential clients.

- If you are signposting your work for future coders who may be maintaining the code or application you wrote.

- In an interview, when demonstrating your ability to reason out a problem.

## How to write pseudocode:
*Write a program in a given language that iterates over numbers 1 to 40. Print out a number for every number except multiples of three, in which case output Fizz. For multiples of five, output Buzz, and for multiples of 3 and 5 output FizzBuzz.*
You might start by representing each requirement as a line of pseudocode:

## Conclusion
The scope for pseudocode goes beyond your remit to grasp a new programming language. It is a valuable practice that helps visualize the code's flow. It outlines what skills or libraries may be required to complete a task. 

Software engineers use it at the start of their journey to gain insight into how a program might flow. Senior engineers use it to demonstrate ideas to a team. There is no one way of writing it, but the style you settle on will resemble the structure of the programming language you like best.
